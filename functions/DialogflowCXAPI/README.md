# Google Cloud Function - Twilio DialogflowCX API 

## QuickRead 

With this cloud function we will receive the user request from Twilio.Then the message is passed to the DialogflowCX API to detect the intent and get the response from DialogflowCX API.
Once we receive the response it is sent back to the user using Twilio.


## Want to know in detail ðŸ‘‡

* With this cloud function we will receive the user request from Whatsapp using TWilio and once the request is received we will destructure it (break the request) to extract the messsage send by the user.
* Now we will detect the intent based on the message sent by the user using DialogflowCX API.Once we receive the response from the matched intent it is sent to the user again using Twilio
* Once we receive the request from Twilo we will do the following

1. The request is destructured and then the message is extracted from the request and it is sent to `detectIntentText` function.
2. In the `detectIntentText` function we will get response once the message is matched with  any of the intent
3. That response message is sent to the user using `sendWhatsappMessage` function
4. To maintain a session for the current user we have passed the `AccountSid` which we received from Twilio as `SessionId` to DialogflowCX API

## Packages used
